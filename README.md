# Mental-health-simulator-

Overview

This project is a Mental Health Simulator developed in Java. It is designed to simulate various mental health scenarios and responses to help individuals understand mental well-being and coping mechanisms. The application runs entirely in a console-based environment, providing basic functionality that can be expanded into a full-fledged, interactive application with a graphical user interface (GUI) in the future.

Features

  ->Simulates various mental health scenarios (e.g., stress, anxiety, depression).

  ->Tracks the user’s progress and responses based on predefined algorithms.

  ->Provides personalized suggestions for mental well-being improvement.

  ->Can be extended to integrate more scenarios, coping strategies, and mental health topics.

  ->Designed to be scalable and modular for easy enhancement with a GUI or web-based frontend.

Future Scope

This Java-based simulator is just the starting point, and it has the potential to evolve into a fully functional application with:

  ->A Graphical User Interface (GUI) using frameworks like JavaFX or Swing.

  ->Integration with external libraries or frameworks for data visualization (e.g., charts to track mental health progress).

  ->A web-based frontend built with technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

  ->Data storage using a database to keep track of users' mental health data over time.

  ->Machine learning models to predict or suggest customized mental health improvement strategies based on user input.


Run the Application

To run the simulator, follow these steps:

1.Open a terminal/command prompt.

2.Navigate to the project folder where you cloned the repo.

3.Compile and run the Java code.
